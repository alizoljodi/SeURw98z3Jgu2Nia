## Introduction
Customer satisfaction is critical for success in the logistics and delivery domain. This project:
- Analyzes survey data from **126 customers**.
- Identifies key features influencing satisfaction.
- Builds predictive models to forecast customer satisfaction.

The survey includes six questions:

1. **X1:** My order was delivered on time  
2. **X2:** The contents of my order were as I expected  
3. **X3:** I ordered everything I wanted to order  
4. **X4:** I paid a good price for my order  
5. **X5:** I am satisfied with my courier  
6. **X6:** The app makes ordering easy for me  

The target variable **Y** indicates whether a customer is satisfied (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

---

## Objectives
1. **Objective 1**: Analyze survey data and extract insights:
   - What are the patterns in the survey responses?
   - Which questions influence dissatisfaction the most?
   - How can mutual information rank the importance of questions?

2. **Objective 2**: Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction.

## Data Analysis

### 1. Dataset Description
- **126 responses** with no missing values.
- Features are rated on a scale of 1 to 5.
- Target variable (Y) is binary: satisfied or unsatisfied.

### 2. Key Observations:
- **45.3\%** of customers are not satisfied.
- **X1**, **X3**, and **X5** are the most important questions based on mutual information.
- **X2** has **zero mutual information** with the satisfaction outcome and can be removed from further analysis.

### 3. Correlation Analysis
Feature-to-feature correlations are low (max correlation: **0.43** between X1 and X5). Therefore, no redundancy exists.

### 4. Data Distribution
Boxplots and statistical descriptions highlight:
- **X1** and **X6** have narrow distributions (low variability).
- Outliers are observed in features like **X2**, requiring further investigation.

## Model Development

We tested multiple machine learning models and optimized them for accuracy:

1. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB)**
   - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) identified **X1**, **X3**, and **X5** as key features.
   - Accuracy: **72.7\%**

2. **LightGBM Classifier (LGBM)**
   - Best accuracy: **76.5\%**
   - Robust performance across all features.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVC)**
   - RFE improved accuracy with features **X1**, **X3**, and **X5**.
   - Accuracy: **72.7\%**

## Key Insights

1. **45.3\% of customers** are dissatisfied.  
2. **X1** (on-time delivery), **X3** (correct order), and **X5** (courier satisfaction) are the most critical questions.  
3. **X2** (order contents) has **zero impact** on satisfaction and can be removed from future surveys.  
4. **LGBM Classifier** is the best-performing model, achieving **76.5\% accuracy**.

## Results

### Model Comparison
| Model                 | Accuracy (%) | F1 Score (%) |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **LGBM Classifier**   | 76.5         | 89.0         |
| BernoulliNB           | 72.7         | 78.4         |
| Support Vector Machine (SVC) | 72.7         | 77.77        |

### Improvement
- Predictions by LGBM outperform random guessing by **40\%** or **1.4Ã— better** accuracy.

## Conclusion

1. **Key Insights**: The most important questions for predicting satisfaction are **X1, X3, and X5**.
2. **Model Performance**: The LGBM Classifier provides the most accurate and generalizable predictions with **76.5\% accuracy**.
3. **Recommendations**: Remove **X2** ("Contents of my order were as I expected") from future surveys due to its zero impact on satisfaction outcomes.

---

## Future Work
1. Expand the dataset to improve generalizability.
2. Implement advanced ensemble methods for further performance gains.
3. Explore additional features such as delivery location, time of day, and courier ratings.
